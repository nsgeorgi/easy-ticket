In todayâ€™s fast rhythm of life that surround us , makes it necessary to save time mainly from waiting times. Researches have shown that an average person waste on average  three years of his life  waiting in queues  to various services such as a bank, the IRs or a hospital. In this paper, we implement a system which is designed to minimize the awaiting queues to public services. Specifically, through a web application (http://www.easy-ticket.gr/ ), the interested user  will be able  to take place in the queue of the service, electronically by his personal computer or mobile device, without  being necessary to the service area. In this way, not only someone saves time from his daily life, but also makes easier the management of a queue in a public service by the employees.
